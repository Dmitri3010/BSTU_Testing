I don't need your forgiveness
I don't need your hate
I don't need your acceptance
So what should I do
I don't need your resistance
I don't need your prayers
I don't need no religion
I don't need a thing from you
I don't do what I've been told
Your so lame why don't you
Just go
Die mother fucker die mother fucker die
I don't need your prison
I don't need your pain
I don't need your decision
So what should I do
